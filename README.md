# Harden Linux Ditributions
A lot of Linux distributions are not secured enough by default. These scripts will fix that problem, and additionally provide optional basic configuration of the operating system.

# Supported operating systems
I only add scripts of operating systems/distributions that I use myself. These are:

* Debian 8 Jessie
* Debian 9 Stretch
* CentOS 7
* Alpine Linux 3.3+

If there is serious demand for another operating system, I might be able to add it also (depending on complexity).

# What does it do?
It depends on the operating system, but generally speaking the scripts will do the following:

1. Check if the script runs as root on the correct operating system.
2. Will be added later

# Customize options
The scripts are more or less modular, you can change the parameters in the top of the script to customize the script to your use case.
